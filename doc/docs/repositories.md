*Direct former README import (possibly not up-to-date)*


From the sbt plugin, the default repositories are the ones provided by sbt (typically Central or JFrog, and `~/.ivy2/local`).

From the CLI tools, these are Central (`https://repo1.maven.org/maven2`) and `~/.ivy2/local`.

From the API, these are specified manually - you are encouraged to use those too.
