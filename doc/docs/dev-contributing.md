## Setting the project up

  - Clone down the [Coursier Repo](https://github.com/coursier/coursier)
  - Change directory in the Coursier root and issue a
      `git submodule update --init`  which will clone down the necessary
      submodules for the project.

  - [`DEVELOP.md`](https://github.com/coursier/coursier/blob/master/DEVELOP.md) at the root
    of the sources lists useful command when developing on coursier (how to compile modules,
    run tests, run the CLI from sources, build a CLI launcher from sources, â€¦)
