This post describes the most notables changes of coursier `2.0.0-RC1`.

## Strict conflict manager

The CLI now accepts options to enable and configure the new strict
conflict manager.

- `--strict` enables the strict conflict manager,
- `--strict-exclude org:name` excludes some modules from being inspected by the strict conflict manager,
- `--strict-include org:name` includes some modules (even if they were excluded by `--strict-exclude`).


## `install` command

The CLI of coursier now has an `install` command. This command was demo-ed
during the Scala Days talk ["All the fancy things you can do with flexible dependency management"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b06iQB_It8o).

The environment variable `COURSIER_EXPERIMENTAL` needs to be `true` for this
command to be enabled. It then allows things like
```bash
$ coursier install scalac sbt-launcher
```
It installs launchers for these applications in an OS-specific directory
(`~/Library/Application Support/Coursier/bin` on OS X,
`~/.local/share/coursier/bin` on Linux), and will warn you if that directory
isn't in your `PATH`.

It also allows to install GraalVM applications if `GRAALVM_HOME` is set
(`coursier install coursier-graalvm`), and scala-native ones too if
[LLVM is installed](https://www.scala-native.org/en/v0.3.9-docs/user/setup.html#installing-clang-and-runtime-dependencies)
(`coursier install echo-native`).

It should be described in more detail in a later post and / or dedicated
page in the coursier website.

## `publish` command

The CLI of coursier now has a `publish` command, allowing to publish
arbitrary sbt projects and directories with a Maven repository-like structure.
It's quite experimental, and should be documented in a later time.

## Dynamically load scala-native tools

The `--native` option of the `bootstrap` command can now deal with several
scala-native versions. It automatically detects the scala-native version
of the dependencies it is passed, and downloads and uses the scala-native
tools from that scala-native version

For example, both of these command work, and use either scala-native
`0.3.9`, or `0.4.0-M2`:
```bash
$ coursier bootstrap io.get-coursier:echo_native0.3_2.11:1.0.1 \
    -o echo-native-0.3 \
    --native
$ coursier bootstrap io.get-coursier:echo_native0.4.0-M2_2.11:1.0.3 \
    -o echo-native-0.4.0-M2 \
    --native
```

## Dependency string completion

coursier now has an API and a CLI command to complete dependency strings,
like
```scala
val (fromIndex, completions) = coursier.Complete()
  .withInput("com.chuusai::shapeless:")
  .withScalaVersion("2.12.8")
  .complete()
```

```bash
$ coursier complete --scala-version 2.12.8 com.chuusai::shapeless:
2.3.2
2.3.3
```

## Fixes

Fix bug in resolution preventing `software.amazon.awssdk:utils:2.5.17`
and `software.amazon.awssdk:auth:2.5.17` to be resolved fine.

## Other

- `--what-depends-on` now accepts patterns like `org:*` or `foo-*:name`
(thanks to [@viqueen](https://github.com/viqueen)
- upon checksum error, both the underlying file and checksum file are deleted
from the cache, and downloaded again (no other attempt / deletion is the second
one still fails)
- global exclusions can be passed to `coursier.Resolve` and `coursier.Fetch`
(rather than manually applied to each dependency)
- early support for `latest.release` and `latest.integration` versions
(improved upon in later versions)
- versions like `0+` are now handled fine
- launchers generated by the `bootstrap` command now read the environment
variable `JAVA_OPTS` when they invoke `java`
