title: 2.0.0-RC3

coursier `2.0.0-RC3` was released.

- [detailed page](/docs/other-version-handling) about version handling (version reconciliation, comparions, â€¦)
- tweaking in version comparison (precedence of alpha / beta / milestone qualifiers could be wrong if they were preceded by some `.0` or `-0`, like when comparing `1.0.Beta1` and `1.0.Final`)
- optimized handling of set of dependencies during resolution, bringing significant perf gains in some cases (dependency graph with a large number of exclusions, like for `org.apache.spark:spark-sql` or `org.apache.spark:spark-repl`)
- fix undetected conflict case (with open right bound of intervals, like `2.3.3` conflicting with `[2.0,2.3.3)`)
- have the strict conflict manager ignore conflicts for versions forced by users (with `-V` on the command-line, and `dependencyOverrides` in sbt)
- default configuration via the API if now `default(compile)` rather
than `compile`. The former pulls runtime definitions for Maven dependencies
in particular.
- stop using okhttp in the CLI, which was creating unexpected daemon threads on
Java 11, making the CLI lag before exiting (`java.net.HttpURLConnection` is now favored, like by the default from the API or the sbt plugin)
- fixes in JSON report (some excluded dependencies could appear in it nonetheless in some cases)
- use jline / jansi to get progress bars working on Windows
- read SCM info from POMs (can then be read via the API)
- cache not found errors for directory listings (allows faster handling of version intervals in particular)
- don't check for the existence of modules before listing their versions (less network requests, and parsing of intermediate listings)
- keep the links of parsed directory listings in cache in parsed form (allows not to parse the HTML page of directory listings again and again)
- compare versions across repositories for `latest.integration`, and not
for version intervals or `latest.release` and `latest.stable`. In the latter case,
repositories are checked successively. First one having a version in the interval is used. Comparing versions across intervals is costly, so the less it's used,
the better.
- more generic conversion to `coursier.util.Sync` in `io.get-coursier::coursier-cats-interop` module
- use checksum from HTTP headers for repositories that provide them, rather than downloading checksum files (less network requests overall)
- better JVM-wide short-lived locks (aiming at circumventing some `OverlappingFileLockException`, when using coursier both directly and via a shaded version of it, in the same JVM)

- classpath order: the output of the `resolve` and `fetch` commands can be
printed in "classpath order", a deterministic order, based on the order of
dependencies in POM files, and with dependencies before their dependees. These
can be obtained via the API too (see `coursier.Fetch.withClasspathOrder`).

- relaxed version reconciliation (by @eed3si9n) - from the CLI, pass `--reconciliation org:name:relaxed` to ignore version interval conflicts for module `org:name`

- GRAALVM
- jlink for windows
