coursier `1.1.0-M13` was just released.

The most notable change of this milestone happened in the high level API, that should be nearing completion. A notion of "rules" is also being added to coursier, and should be described in more details in a later post.

## High level API

This API aims at being as simple to use as the CLI of coursier, while retaining the purity of the former low level API - without all its traps.

For example, one can fetch a few dependencies with
```scala
import coursier._

val files = Fetch()
  .addDependencies(
    dep"org.http4s:http4s-dsl_2.12:0.18.22",
    dep"org.tpolecat:doobie-core_2.12:0.6.0"
  )
  .run()

// files: Seq[java.io.File]
```

It relies on a "builder pattern", not unlike [sttp](https://softwaremill.com/introducing-sttp-the-scala-http-client). Numerous parameters can be adjusted by calling other methods before `run`.

`run()` runs resolutions and downloads artifacts synchronously, but can be substituted by `future()` or `io` to run things
in the background, via a `Future` or the IO monad of your choice.

More details can be found [in the documentation](/docs/1.1.0-M13/api).

The CLI and the sbt plugins of coursier already rely on this API. In the future, this should ensure that more advanced features, added in the CLI or the sbt plugin of coursier, are available to API users straightaway.

## Rules

Motivated by [SCP-20](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/020-sbt-transitive-dependencies-conflicts.md), support for enforcing some "rules" is being added to coursier. These are a bit similar to those of the [Maven enforcer plugin](https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/maven-enforcer-plugin), and allow to emulate the [strict conflict manager of Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.5.0-rc1/settings/conflict-managers.html).

While details are still being ironed out, the CLI already accepts rules.

For example, one can require all the jackson modules to have the same version with
```bash
$ coursier resolve org.apache.spark:spark-sql_2.12:2.4.0 \
    --rules 'SameVersion(com.fasterxml.jackson.*:jackson-*)'
…
com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations:2.7.9:default
com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core:2.7.9:default
com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.7.9:default
com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-paranamer:2.7.9:default
com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-scala_2.12:2.7.9:default
…
```

By default, rules that don't pass try to address the underlying issue. One can instead require resolution to fail, like
```bash
$ coursier resolve org.apache.spark:spark-sql_2.12:2.4.0 \
    --rules 'fail:SameVersion(com.fasterxml.jackson.*:jackson-*)'
Resolution error: Unsatisfiable rule …
```

An upcoming post should describe rules and future plans in more details.
