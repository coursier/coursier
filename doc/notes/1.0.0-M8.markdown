### Changes

* A Java 6 compatible branch was created ([java-6] - as remarked by @fommil,
  Java 6 is still the official Java version of Scala)
* Fix a regression in class loader isolation of the `launch` command ([#142])
* MIMA SBT plugin is added to the `core` and `cache` modules, aiming at backward
  binary compatibility as of 1.0.0-M8 ([#140])
* Nicer progress bars in the CLI and SBT plugin output ([#136])
* Proguarded standalone JAR of the CLI app is now automatically pushed to
  Sonatype, ([standalone] JAR, [#148]). Should be used as the only dependency of
  the default launcher in the future.
