### Changes

* Fix `java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError` exception with Java 9 ([#678])
* Fix "Missing Ivy XML" errors, with sbt >= 1.0.2, when publishing with sbt-pgp ([#679])
* Use [OS-specific directory](https://github.com/soc/directories) by default for the cache of coursier. Note that if a `~/.coursier` already exists on your machine, it will be peaked by coursier instead of the OS-specific directory. If it doesn't, the OS-specific directory will be created and used ([#676], thanks to [@soc])
