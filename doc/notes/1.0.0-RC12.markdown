### Changes

* Fix small glitch when reading exclusions from POMs ([#648])
* More careful handling of dependencies between tasks in sbt plugin, via `Def.taskDyn` ([#651])
* Filter out sbt preloaded repos by default (these don't bring much when sbt-coursier is enabled, set the `coursierKeepPreloaded` setting to `true` to re-enabled, [#651])
* Add helper to make it easy to bump sbt-coursier version if sbt-coursier is loaded from `project/project/plugins.sbt` (add a `addSbtPlugin("io.get-coursier" % "sbt-coursier" % "1.0.0-RC12")` in `project/project/plugins.sbt`, then just a `addSbtCoursier` in `project/plugins.sbt` - [#651])
* Fix `MatchError` when using cross version patch with sbt 1.0 ([#658])
