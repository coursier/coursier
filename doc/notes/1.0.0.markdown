### Changes

* In the sbt plugin, clean the in-memory caches of coursier in the `clean` command (thanks to [@olivierdeckers], [#690])
* Handle version intervals specifying only one version (like `[1.2.0]`, [#702])
* In the CLI tool, take into account the `coursier.ivy.home` and `ivy.home` Java properties to locate the local Ivy2 repository ([#705], thanks to [@Mocuto])
* Ensure support for artifacts with type `bundle` is fine with Maven snapshot versioning ([#706])
* Fix `ExceptionInInitializerError` on FreeBSD ([#707], via [@soc]'s [directories])
* Allow to build the CLI tool with [Pants] (thanks to [@wisechengyi], [#709])
* In the sbt plugin, don't evaluate unnecessary tasks that incur IO ([#711])
* Don't require adding a jboss repository in `plugins.sbt` or fail with a checksum error with some sbt plugins (sbt-assembly in particular, [#712])
* Move some coursier data types to / from sbt data types conversions to a separate module, `sbt-shared` ([#712])
