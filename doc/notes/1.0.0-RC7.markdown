### Changes

* Fix regressions that increased the number of iterations during resolution (and were possibly slowing resolutions, [#599])
* Make Maven property handling more robust ([#599])

* Allow to generate native launchers, e.g.
```
    $ coursier bootstrap -S -o native-test io.get-coursier.scala-native::sandbox_native0.3:0.3.0-coursier-1
```
generates a scala-native-based launcher (`native-test`) for... a hello world ([#598]).

* Fix issue with classifiers and Ivy repositories, from the sbt plugin ([#609])
* Ensure the API doesn't return optional artifacts if not asked to ([#606])
