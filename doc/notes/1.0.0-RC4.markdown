### Changes

* Better support for Maven snapshot versioning (thanks to [@rfkm], [#581])
* Add basic support for multiple version ranges (like `[1.0,2.0),[3.0,4.0)`, [#581])
* Fix support for version ranges for sbt plugins from Maven repositories ([#581])
* Support sbt `1.0.0-M6` (replaces support for `1.0.0-M5`, [#560])
* Have boostraps use the main coursier cache ([#576])
* More slick tree printing (thanks to [@sschuberth], [#574])
* Better support for version ranges like `1.2.3-+` (thanks to [@avdv], [#556])
* New `sbt-pgp-coursier` plugin, to download `sbt-pgp` checksums via coursier ([#571])
* (Even) more careful handling of HTTP connections ([#568])
* Don't fail if another coursier run downloads a file concurrently - watch the concurrent download instead, report its progress, and take over it if it gets interrupted ([#568])
* Switch to scala-js `0.6.17` ([#565])
* Ensure Nexus proxies (Nexus 2 and 3) support is fine (some regressions in `1.0.0-RC1`, fixed in [#554])
* Don't mix resolutions of distinct Ivy configuration subgraphs in `sbt-coursier` (allows `neo-sbt-scalafmt` `0.2` to be fine with `sbt-coursier`, [#554], and extra non regression test in [#572] by [@dotta])
* Add support for binary checksum files ([#554])
