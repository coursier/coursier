# Contact

As much as possible, use public channels to ask questions and report issues about coursier.

For urgent security-related requests (especially CVEs before public disclosure), please contact
both [myself](mailto:alexandre.archambault@gmail.com) (Alex Archambault) *and*
the [coursier-security mailing list](coursier-security@googlegroups.com).

A number of employees from the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch) and the
[VirtusLab open source team](https://github.com/VirtusLab) have write access to the coursier
repository in case of emergency.
