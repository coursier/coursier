# Funding

While coursier received contributions from more than a hundred people
(most notably through [code](https://github.com/coursier/coursier/graphs/contributors)),
it is developped in large part by [Alex Archambault](https://github.com/alexarchambault).

While I (Alex Archambault) worked on coursier on my own time, I've also been paid along
the years to work on it, by

* the Scala Center (2018-2019, then sparsely in 2020)
* VirtusLab (2021-2023, as part of my work on [Scala CLI](https://github.com/VirtusLab/scala-cli), that I'm also a main author of, albeit in a lesser extent than coursier)
* Li Haoyi (2024 - on going, while working on the [Mill build tool](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/mill))

If you're interested in funding specific features of coursier, or even more generally the overall
development of coursier, do not hesitate to reach me on LinkedIn, X, or via
[e-mail](mailto:alexandre.archambault@gmail.com) - see the links
on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/alexarchambault).
