# Binaries

CLI is available as native binaries, and as
a JAR that needs an already installed JVM to run.

Use binaries if one is available for your system (Linux and Mac on x86-64 and ARM64, Windows on x86-64)

Else install a JVM on your own and use the JVM launcher (Windows on ARM64, *BSD, â€¦)

Linux binaries are available for both x86-64 and ARM64. Extra shades of Linux binaries are
also available for both CPU architectures: static binaries (no dynamic library dependencies, suitable
for systems like Alpine), container binaries (`-H:-UseContainerSupport`, https://github.com/coursier/coursier/pull/2742)
